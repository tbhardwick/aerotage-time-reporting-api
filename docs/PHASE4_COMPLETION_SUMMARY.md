## 🔧 PowerTools v2.x Implementation Pattern

Each migrated function follows the established pattern:

```typescript
// PowerTools v2.x imports
import { logger, businessLogger, addRequestContext } from '../shared/powertools-logger';
import { tracer, businessTracer } from '../shared/powertools-tracer';
import { metrics, businessMetrics } from '../shared/powertools-metrics';

// PowerTools v2.x middleware
import { injectLambdaContext } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/logger/middleware';
import { captureLambdaHandler } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/tracer/middleware';
import { logMetrics } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/metrics/middleware';
import middy from '@middy/core';

const lambdaHandler = async (event: APIGatewayProxyEvent): Promise<APIGatewayProxyResult> => {
  const startTime = Date.now();
  
  try {
    // Request context setup
    const requestId = event.requestContext.requestId;
    addRequestContext(requestId);
    businessTracer.addRequestContext(requestId, event.httpMethod, event.resource);

    // Business operation tracing
    const result = await businessTracer.traceBusinessOperation(
      'operation-name',
      'entity-type',
      async () => {
        // Business logic here
      }
    );

    // Database operation tracing
    const data = await businessTracer.traceDatabaseOperation(
      'database-operation',
      'table-name',
      async () => {
        // Database operations here
      }
    );

    // Performance and business metrics
    const responseTime = Date.now() - startTime;
    businessMetrics.trackApiPerformance(endpoint, method, statusCode, responseTime);
    businessLogger.logBusinessOperation(operation, entity, userId, success, context);

  } catch (error) {
    // Enhanced error handling with business context
  }
};

// Export with PowerTools middleware
export const handler = middy(lambdaHandler)
  .use(captureLambdaHandler(tracer))
  .use(injectLambdaContext(logger))
  .use(logMetrics(metrics));
```
